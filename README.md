## Getting started

Prerequisites (you should install these)
* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Upgrading packages

Upgrading to a new version of React Native requires updating the `react-native`, `react`, and `expo` package versions, and setting the correct `sdkVersion` in `app.json`. See the [versioning guide](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/VERSIONS.md) for up-to-date information about package version compatibility.

## Scripts

### `expo start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it. It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

### `npm run-script watch-test`

Runs jest in --watch mode.
